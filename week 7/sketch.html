    <p><strong>Gustav Klimt:</strong> Gustav Klimt was an Austrian symbolist painter known for his highly decorative style and iconic imagery, which often explored themes of love, sensuality, and the human condition. His innovative use of gold leaf and intricate patterns, combined with his bold compositions, made him one of the most prominent figures of the Vienna Secession movement and a pioneer of modern art.</p>
